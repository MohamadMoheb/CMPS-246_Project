<h3>Who We Are<h3>

Customers use our platform to search and discover restaurants, read and write customer generated reviews and view and upload photos, order food delivery, book a table and make payments while dining-out at restaurants. On the other hand, we provide restaurant partners with industry-specific marketing tools which enable them to engage and acquire customers to grow their business while also providing a reliable and efficient last mile delivery service. We also operate a one-stop procurement solution, Hyperpure, which supplies high quality ingredients and kitchen products to restaurant partners. We also provide our delivery partners with transparent and flexible earning opportunities.</P>
    <pre>City express was an online food ordering and restaurant finding platform started as just an idea. The idea of Zomato took place in the mind of Reem mahmasani ,Mohammad mheb  CS  students who were always on the lookout for new places to eat. What started off as a collection of menus from a small list of restaurants has today grown into a massive conglomerate City express as a business grew so quickly,  had more than 2,000 menus on its database by the end of 2030!. 

        It was co-founded by Mohamad Moheb , Reem Oussama mahmasani ,and ahmad ramadan . Over the years city Express has grown by leaps and bounds and today it is only fitting that we take a look at its growth for all these years.
